# Canvas
it is a small project which contains the concept of gsap where i implemented the canvas module and created an animated web page. 

I have not given the images file as it contains more than 200 images and it is not possible to upload it. so in the script file when you will come across the function in which we have to give the images in the canvas you can download the images that you like and then use it in the code.
thanks!
